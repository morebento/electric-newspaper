## What It Is

The Electric Newspaper was a daily online newspaper produced by web design studio [Virtual Artists Pty Ltd](http://www.va.com.au) on Rundle Street, Adelaide, and edited by veteran broadcast journalist **Hendrik Gout**. It published 711 articles across eleven sections — news, essays, arts, film reviews, books, sport, food, holidays, fringe, letters, and a regular column — written by working journalists, academics, politicians, and critics.

It operated for seven months before publishing its final edition on 31 July 1998, with the farewell note: *"No time to say hello, see ya!"*

The paper's coverage was almost entirely South Australian in focus. Its seven-month lifespan coincided with two major political stories: the Olsen Liberal government's surprise decision to privatise ETSA (breaking a specific election promise), and the parliamentary privileges scandal surrounding Deputy Premier Graham Ingerson. It also covered the 1998 Adelaide Festival and Fringe season, and chronicled the Adelaide Rams' final, ill-fated NRL season.

## Restoration Notes

The archive was preserved on Internode's Unix server as a tar file after the paper closed in July 1998, and sat dormant until 2024.

**The problem:** The tar extraction had truncated all filenames to eight characters — a Unix filesystem artefact — breaking every image reference in all 711 HTML articles. Additionally, many images were referenced via absolute URLs pointing to the defunct `www.electric.on.net` domain.

**What was recovered:** Systematic analysis mapped all but 2 broken image references back to their original files. All 711 articles, story photographs, navigation button GIFs, section header GIFs, advertisement graphics, and contributor portrait photos are intact. Of 18,000+ image references in the archive, 14,653 resolve correctly, 144 are external dead-ad URLs, and just 2 files (`news/logosa4.jpg` and `news/newlogosmall1.gif`) are genuinely absent from the original tar archive.

**Changes made to the original HTML:**
- Image paths corrected throughout (broken → relative)
- 269 absolute `http://www.electric.on.net/ads/...` URLs rewritten as relative paths
- Navigation links fixed (wrong extensions, one dead domain reference)
- Netscape 3-era rollover button JavaScript disabled for browser compatibility — original source preserved verbatim in HTML comments with attribution to authors Dave Sag and Mark King, Virtual Artists Pty Ltd, 1997
- Section `index.htm` pages built (did not exist in original archive)
- Root `index.htm` rebuilt as an entrance page

The article text and body HTML is entirely original and unmodified.

## Technical Details

All pages were hand-coded in HTML 3.2 by Chris Joyner and Ben Moretti of Virtual Artists. The site used a two-column table layout (standard for 1998), with navigation handled by a rollover button system written in JavaScript by Dave Sag and Mark King of Virtual Artists in July 1997.

The paper was hosted at `electric.on.net` on a Unix server provided by [Internode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internode_(ISP)), the Adelaide-based ISP founded in 1991 by Simon Hackett and Robyn Taylor. Internode and Cobweb Internet Services are acknowledged as sponsors on every page of the paper.
